"""Benchmark / demo query catalog for the Edge AI deployment KG.

Each entry is a question an edge-AI team actually asks while trying to land a
model on custom silicon. The `why_graph` field records why the question is
awkward in a relational or document store -- most of these are variable-depth
joins across hardware, kernel-library and model structure, or anti-joins
("which operator has NO kernel here").

Engine notes:
  * `NOT (pattern)` does not parse on this build; anti-joins are written as
    `OPTIONAL MATCH ... WITH ... count(x) AS n ... WHERE n = 0`.
  * String literals must be double-quoted.
