# Benchmarks

16 queries covering the questions an edge-AI team asks while landing a model on
custom silicon. Each entry in [`queries.py`](queries.py) carries the plain
question, the Cypher, and a `why_graph` note explaining why the question is
awkward in a relational or document store.

```bash
python -m benchmarks.run_benchmark --url http://127.0.0.1:8080   # all 16
python -m benchmarks.run_benchmark --only EA01 --rows 20         # one
python -m benchmarks.run_benchmark --json-out results.json       # machine-readable
```

Omit `--url` to run against an in-process embedded engine.

## Current results

> **Stale — measured on the 12-query catalog, before EA13-EA16 were added.**
> Re-running it needs the `samyama` server binary, which lives in the engine
> repo, not here; the embedded engine is in-process and cannot be loaded by one
> command and queried by the next. The figures below are kept as the last
> recorded run rather than silently restated for 16 queries.
> `README.md` quotes a later 16-query run: all 16 return rows, median 14 ms,
> slowest 73 ms, on 25,145 nodes / 76,291 edges.

Samyama Graph v1.7.0 OSS, 24,115 nodes / 73,825 edges, server on localhost:

**12/12 queries return rows, 0 empty, 0 failed. Median 15 ms, slowest 71 ms.**

The slow end are the queries that touch all 21,844 kernels (EA08, EA11); the
anti-joins that anchor on a single model run in 30-40 ms.

## A warning about "it returned rows"

Three of the engine behaviours in [`../docs/engine-notes.md`](../docs/engine-notes.md)
return **wrong rows rather than errors**. EA04 originally returned 12
confident-looking rows that paired one model's fp32 variant with another
model's int8 variant. Treat a green run as necessary, not sufficient —
[`../tests/test_correctness.py`](../tests/test_correctness.py) is what actually
checks the answers.
