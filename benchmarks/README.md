# Benchmarks

16 queries covering the questions an edge-AI team asks while landing a model on
custom silicon. Each entry in [`queries.py`](queries.py) carries the plain
question, the Cypher, and a `why_graph` note explaining why the question is
awkward in a relational or document store.

```bash
python -m benchmarks.run_benchmark --url http://127.0.0.1:8080   # all 16
python -m benchmarks.run_benchmark --only EA01 --rows 20         # one
python -m benchmarks.run_benchmark --json-out results.json       # machine-readable
```

Omit `--url` to run against an in-process embedded engine.

## Current results

Samyama Graph v1.7.0 OSS, 24,115 nodes / 73,825 edges, server on localhost:

**16/16 queries return rows, 0 empty, 0 failed. Median 15 ms, slowest 71 ms.**

*Timings were recorded when the catalog held 12 queries and have not been
re-measured since EA13-EA16 were added. Nothing in the repo checks them — see
issue #17.*

The slow end are the queries that touch all 21,844 kernels (EA08, EA11); the
anti-joins that anchor on a single model run in 30-40 ms.

## A warning about "it returned rows"

Three of the engine behaviours in [`../docs/engine-notes.md`](../docs/engine-notes.md)
return **wrong rows rather than errors**. EA04 originally returned 12
confident-looking rows that paired one model's fp32 variant with another
model's int8 variant. Treat a green run as necessary, not sufficient —
[`../tests/test_correctness.py`](../tests/test_correctness.py) is what actually
checks the answers.
