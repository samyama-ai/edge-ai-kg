# Engine notes -- Samyama Graph v1.7.0 (and the embedded build, notes 10-11)

Behaviour observed while building this KG.
**Notes 1-9 are filed upstream** — see the tracking issue
[samyama-graph#368](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/368).

Notes 1-9 were observed on the OSS engine at v1.7.0
(`target/release/samyama --http-port 8080`). Every one of them is load-bearing:
the loader or the query catalog works around it. Verified 2026-08-14.

**Notes 10 and 11 are a different kind of entry.** Neither is a behaviour of the
server: both are disagreements between the server and the in-process embedded
build, neither is filed upstream, and nothing works around either. Between them
they are why three tests in `tests/test_correctness.py` are marked `xfail`:

| Test | Note |
|---|---|
| `test_every_catalog_query_runs_and_returns_rows` | 10 |
| `test_order_by_is_actually_applied` | 10 |
| `test_ea04_quantization_unlock_is_not_a_cartesian_product` | **11** |

Verified 2026-08-28 and 2026-08-31, both tracked at #56.

## 1. A trailing bound variable in a second MATCH clause is not joined

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#360](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/360)

**Severity: correctness. Silently returns wrong rows.**

When a second `MATCH` clause re-mentions a variable bound by an earlier `MATCH`,
and that variable appears in a **non-leading position** in the second pattern
while *another* shared variable leads it, the engine does not enforce the join.
It returns a cartesian product instead.

Minimal reproduction -- one board `B1`, two models `M1`/`M2`, each with an fp32
and an int8 variant deployed on `B1`:

```cypher
MATCH (b:RBd)<-[:R_ON]-(d1:RDp)-[:R_OF]->(v1:RVr)-[:R_VO]->(m:RMd) WHERE v1.p="fp32"
MATCH (b)<-[:R_ON]-(d2:RDp)-[:R_OF]->(v2:RVr)-[:R_VO]->(m)         WHERE v2.p="int8"
RETURN m.id, v1.id, v2.id
```

Expected 2 rows (`M1,M1fp32,M1int8` and `M2,M2fp32,M2int8`). **Got 4** -- the
cross pairs `M1,M2fp32,M1int8` and `M2,M1fp32,M2int8` are also returned. `v2` is
correctly constrained to `m`; `v1` is not.

Variants tested:

| Shape | Small graph | Full graph (24K nodes) |
|---|---|---|
| 2nd MATCH, shared var **trailing**, another shared var leading | **WRONG** | **WRONG** |
| 2nd MATCH, shared var **leading** | correct | correct |
| 2nd MATCH, only one shared variable | correct | correct |
| `WITH` between the two MATCH clauses | **WRONG** | **WRONG** |
| Single MATCH, comma-separated patterns | correct | **WRONG** |

**Note the last row.** The comma-separated single-`MATCH` form looks like a fix
on a toy graph and still breaks at scale -- presumably a different join plan is
chosen once the cardinalities and indexes are real. Any "workaround" for this
bug must be validated on a full-size graph; a passing 6-node reproduction proves
nothing.

**Workaround actually used here:** avoid the self-join entirely. `EA04` is
written as a single linear pattern plus conditional aggregation
(`sum(CASE WHEN ... )`), which has no second binding to lose:

```cypher
MATCH (m:Model)<-[:VARIANT_OF]-(v:ModelVariant)<-[:OF_VARIANT]-(d:Deployment)-[:ON_BOARD]->(b:Board)
WITH m.name AS model, b.name AS board,
     sum(CASE WHEN v.precision = "fp32" AND d.fits = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fp32_misses,
     sum(CASE WHEN v.precision = "int8" AND d.fits = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS int8_hits,
     max(CASE WHEN v.precision = "fp32" THEN v.size_kb ELSE 0 END) AS fp32_kb,
     max(CASE WHEN v.precision = "int8" THEN v.size_kb ELSE 0 END) AS int8_kb
WHERE fp32_misses > 0 AND int8_hits > 0
RETURN model, board, fp32_kb, int8_kb
```

Because `int8_kb` is by construction exactly `fp32_kb / 4`, a cartesian product
is *detectable*: `tests/test_correctness.py` asserts that ratio, and
`test_ea04_shape_is_not_a_cartesian_product` pins the behaviour on a
purpose-built 4-deployment fixture.

## 2. `RETURN DISTINCT` is a no-op

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#361](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/361)

**Severity: correctness. Returns duplicate rows.**

```cypher
MATCH (b:Board) RETURN DISTINCT b.form_factor
```

returns 120 rows (one per board) across 8 distinct form factors. Multi-column
`RETURN DISTINCT` is equally ineffective.

`DISTINCT` *inside an aggregate* -- `count(DISTINCT op)` -- works correctly and
is used throughout the catalog.

**Workaround used here:** deduplicate with a `WITH`-grouping plus an aggregate,
which groups correctly:

```cypher
MATCH (b:Board) WITH b.form_factor AS f, b.year AS y, count(b) AS n RETURN f, y, n
```

---

## 3. `ORDER BY` on a RETURN-introduced alias is silently ignored

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#362](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/362)

**Severity: correctness. Returns an arbitrary subset when combined with LIMIT.**

```cypher
MATCH (d:Deployment) RETURN d.latency_ms AS a ORDER BY a ASC LIMIT 6
-- returns 10.976, 12.771, 7.569, 9.003, ...   (unsorted)
```

An alias introduced in `RETURN` cannot be referenced by `ORDER BY`. The clause
is dropped without error. Combined with `LIMIT`, this is worse than an unsorted
result: `ORDER BY latency ASC LIMIT 12` returns *an arbitrary 12 rows*, not the
twelve fastest -- while looking exactly like a top-N.

| Form | Result |
|---|---|
| `RETURN d.latency_ms ORDER BY d.latency_ms` | correct |
| `RETURN d.latency_ms AS a ORDER BY d.latency_ms` | correct |
| `RETURN d.latency_ms AS a ORDER BY a` | **ignored** |
| `WITH d.latency_ms AS a RETURN a ORDER BY a` | correct |
| `WITH ... count(x) AS n RETURN n ORDER BY n` | correct |

Aliases introduced by `WITH` work; aliases introduced by `RETURN` do not. A
`RETURN` containing an aggregate happens to work, because the implicit grouping
pass establishes the alias.

**Workaround used here:** every catalog query projects through a `WITH` before
`RETURN`, and sorts on the `WITH` alias.

### 3b. Only the first `ORDER BY` key is honoured

`ORDER BY category, operator` sorts by `category` and leaves `operator`
unsorted within each group. Multi-key sorts are therefore avoided entirely;
`tests/test_correctness.py::test_order_by_is_actually_applied` asserts every
catalog query uses a single sort key *and* that the result really is sorted.

---

## 4. `min()` mis-compares an integer sentinel against float values

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#365](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/365)

```cypher
RETURN min(CASE WHEN v.precision = "int8" THEN v.size_kb ELSE 999999   END)  -- 999999  (wrong)
RETURN min(CASE WHEN v.precision = "int8" THEN v.size_kb ELSE 999999.0 END)  -- 6.9     (right)
```

With an `int` sentinel, `min()` returns the sentinel even though float values
compare smaller. Writing the sentinel as a float fixes it. This is the same
int/float coercion weakness that makes `WHERE n.x > 0.5` return nothing when
`x` was stored as an int -- **keep numeric literal types consistent with the
stored property type.**

---

## 5. Negated pattern predicates do not parse

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#367](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/367)

`WHERE NOT (:Acc)-[:SUPPORTS]->(op)` is a parse error.

**Workaround used here:** the standard anti-join, which works correctly:

```cypher
MATCH (op:Operator)
OPTIONAL MATCH (k:Kernel)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(op)
WITH op, count(k) AS kernels
WHERE kernels = 0
RETURN op.name
```

---

## 6. `CREATE CONSTRAINT ... REQUIRE ... IS UNIQUE` does not parse

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#367](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/367)

Only `CREATE INDEX ON :Label(prop)` is accepted. Uniqueness of `id` is therefore
a loader invariant, not an engine-enforced one -- ids are minted deterministically
in `etl/generate.py`.

---

## 7. The tenant / graph argument is ignored on the OSS HTTP path

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#366](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/366)

`client.query(cypher, "some_graph")` writes to, and reads from, the single
`default` graph regardless of the name passed. Writing to `graph_a` is visible
from `graph_b`, and `list_graphs()` only ever reports `default`.

This is consistent with multi-tenancy being an Enterprise Edition feature, but
it is worth knowing: **passing a graph name does not isolate anything on OSS.**
Two datasets loaded into "different" graphs will silently merge.

**Workaround used here:** the loader defaults to `default` and resets the graph
before loading, rather than relying on tenant isolation.

---

## 8. Deleted property columns resurrect onto new nodes

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#364](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/364)

**Severity: data integrity. Stale values from deleted data appear on new data.**

```cypher
CREATE (:GhostProp {id: "a", ghost: "LEAKED"});
MATCH (n:GhostProp) DETACH DELETE n;          -- count is now 0
CREATE (:GhostProp {id: "b"});                -- note: no `ghost` property
MATCH (n:GhostProp) RETURN n.id, n.ghost;     -- ["b", "LEAKED"]   <-- expected null
```

A node created without a property inherits the value the *previous* generation
of nodes had for that column. A global `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` does not help
either -- the columnar property store survives the delete.

We hit this for real: an internal `_chain` field briefly leaked onto `Sensor`
nodes, and after the generator was fixed and the graph reloaded, **every Sensor
still reported the stale blob** even though the source data no longer contained
it. It looked like the fix had failed.

**Workaround:** `DETACH DELETE` is not a reset. To genuinely reset a graph,
stop the server and start it against a fresh data directory:

```bash
pkill -f '[t]arget/release/samyama'
rm -rf <data-dir>/samyama_data
samyama --http-port 8080
```

**Corollary:** never rely on `DETACH DELETE` between experiments that change a
node's property *schema*. Changing values is fine; removing a property is not.

### 8b. `<>` against a null property matches

`WHERE s._chain <> ""` returns rows where `s._chain` is null. Standard Cypher
would treat `null <> ""` as null and filter the row out. Use an explicit
`IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` check instead of inequality when a property may be
absent.

---

## 9. Aggregating a bare node variable over a multi-variable MATCH does not aggregate

> Filed upstream: [samyama-graph#363](https://github.com/samyama-ai/samyama-graph/issues/363)

**Severity: correctness. Returns N rows of `1` instead of one total.**

```cypher
MATCH (k:Kernel)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(op:Operator)
WHERE k.execution_provider = "CPUExecutionProvider"
RETURN count(DISTINCT op) AS n
-- 293 rows, each containing 1      <-- expected one row with the operator count
```

Aggregating a *property* works; aggregating the bare node variable does not:

| Query | Result |
|---|---|
| `RETURN count(DISTINCT o)` over a 2-variable MATCH | **3 rows of `1`** |
| `RETURN count(o)` over a 2-variable MATCH | **3 rows of `1`** |
| `RETURN count(DISTINCT o.id)` | 1 row: `2` — correct |
| `WITH count(DISTINCT o.id) AS n RETURN n` | 1 row: `2` — correct |
| `RETURN count(DISTINCT n)` over a 1-variable MATCH | correct |

The aggregate appears to group implicitly by the other bound variable instead of
collapsing the whole result set.

**Rule adopted here:** always aggregate a property, never a bare node variable.
Every `count(DISTINCT x)` in the catalog is written `count(DISTINCT x.id)`.

---

## 10. The embedded build does not register an alias introduced by a second `WITH`

> Not filed upstream. Tracked here as #56 — unlike notes 1-9 this is a
> disagreement between two builds, not a behaviour of the server.

`SamyamaClient.embedded()` (`samyama` 0.6.1 from pip) and the HTTP server
(`ghcr.io/samyama-ai/samyama-graph:1`, labelled 1.7.0) do not answer the same
question. A second `WITH` that introduces a **new** alias from a property
expression is not registered on the embedded build:

| Statement | embedded | HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| `WITH n.name AS a RETURN a` | ok | ok |
| `WITH n, count(n.id) AS c RETURN n.name, c` | ok | ok |
| `WITH n WITH n.name AS a RETURN a` | **`Variable not found: a`** | ok |
| `WITH n, count(n.id) AS c WITH n.name AS a RETURN a` | **`Variable not found: a`** | ok |
| `WITH n, count(n.id) AS c WHERE c > 0 WITH n.name AS a RETURN a` | **`Variable not found: a`** | ok |
| `WITH n, count(n.id) AS c WITH n, c RETURN n.name, c` | ok | ok |

Carrying existing variables through a second `WITH` is fine. It is introducing a
new one that fails, so the last row is what makes this narrow rather than
"chained `WITH` is broken".

Minimal reproduction against an otherwise empty graph:

```python
from samyama import SamyamaClient
c = SamyamaClient.embedded()
c.query('CREATE (:Probe {id: "p1", name: "a"})', "default")
c.query("MATCH (n:Probe) WITH n WITH n.name AS a RETURN a", "default")
# RuntimeError: Query error: Variable not found: a
```

The same three lines against `SamyamaClient.connect("http://127.0.0.1:8080")`
return one row.

**Why it bites here:** the workaround for note 3 is to project through a `WITH`
before `RETURN` so `ORDER BY` is honoured. EA01 and EA02 already need a `WITH`
for their anti-join aggregation, so that projection is a *second* one — the
workaround for one note is what triggers this one. Both queries return rows
against the server (`run_benchmark` reports 16/16, 0 failed) and both fail under
`pytest`, which uses the embedded build.

**No workaround adopted** — the queries are not rewritten to avoid the shape,
because which engine the suite should treat as authoritative is an open
decision (#56), and rewriting them now would encode a guess as a fix.

What *was* decided: `test_every_catalog_query_runs_and_returns_rows` and
`test_order_by_is_actually_applied` carry `xfail(strict=False)` naming this
note. Both sweep the whole catalog and so hit EA01 and EA02. `pytest` stays
green and the divergence stays visible in every run rather than as red lines
nobody reads; `strict=False` means an XPASS is not a failure, so if the embedded
build starts agreeing the run says so and the marks come off.

The third failing test, `test_ea04_quantization_unlock_is_not_a_cartesian_product`,
is **not** this note — EA04 has a single `WITH`. See note 11.

---

## 11. The two builds disagree on the type of `sum(CASE ... THEN <int> ... END)`, so a `WHERE` on it is dropped

> Not filed upstream. Tracked with note 10 under #56 — a second embedded/HTTP
> divergence, different shape. Verified 2026-08-31.

Four nodes, two groups, one of which should be filtered out:

```cypher
MATCH (g:WGrp)
WITH g.k AS k, sum(CASE WHEN g.k = "A" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS hits
WHERE hits > 0
RETURN k, hits ORDER BY k
```

| | embedded (`samyama` 0.6.1) | HTTP (v1.7.0) |
|---|---|---|
| `sum(CASE ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` returns | **float** — `2.0`, `0.0` | **int** — `2`, `0` |
| `WHERE hits > 0` (int literal) | **not applied** — both groups | applied — `A` only |
| `WHERE hits > 0.0` (float literal) | applied — `A` only | **not applied** — no rows at all |
| no `WHERE` | both groups | both groups |

The aggregate's *type* is what differs. Note 4 already records that this engine
mis-compares across int and float, so the predicate is silently dropped on
whichever build the literal does not match — and **no literal is correct on
both**: `> 0` filters on the server only, `> 0.0` on the embedded build only.
Nothing errors either way.

**What it costs.** `EA04` uses `WHERE fp32_misses > 0 AND int8_hits > 0`, so on
the server it filters and on the embedded build it does not. The unfiltered
groups are single-deployment ones where the only variant is `fp32`, so they
carry `int8_hits = 0.0` and `max(CASE WHEN v.precision = "int8" ... ELSE 0 END)`
correctly returns the `ELSE` sentinel:

```
EA04 on the HTTP server        EA04 on the embedded build
fp32_kb    int8_kb             fp32_kb    int8_kb   int8_hits
 3347.6      836.9              18125.6         0        0.0
  558.0      139.5              10224.4         0        0.0
  305.6       76.4               9929.2         0        0.0
```

The server's rows are right — `int8_kb` is exactly `fp32_kb / 4`. The embedded
rows are groups that should never have reached `RETURN`.

**Why `test_ea04_shape_is_not_a_cartesian_product` still passes** on the same
embedded build, despite the same four conditional aggregates and the same
`WHERE`: its purpose-built fixture is four deployments in two groups, and *every*
group satisfies `fp32_misses > 0 AND int8_hits > 0`. Whether the predicate is
applied or not, the same two rows come back. The divergence is invisible to any
query whose groups all pass — which is why it surfaces on the generated graph
and not on the fixture.

**No workaround adopted**, for the same reason as note 10: #56 has not decided
which build is authoritative, and there is no literal that would be correct on
both anyway, so any rewrite would be choosing an engine. See the mark on
`tests/test_correctness.py::test_ea04_quantization_unlock_is_not_a_cartesian_product`.

---

## What works well

Everything the catalog depends on, other than the above:
`OPTIONAL MATCH`, `WITH` + aggregation (`count`/`sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max`/`collect`)
— though see note 10 on chaining two of them against the embedded build —
variable-length paths (`-[:R*0..3]->`), `shortestPath`, `CASE`, `IN`, `SKIP` / `LIMIT`, string functions, `EXPLAIN`, and `CREATE INDEX`.

Load throughput on this box (RTX 4050 laptop, server on localhost):
~35K nodes/s batched 250-per-`CREATE`, ~3.1K edges/s batched 100-per-statement
using `MATCH ... WHERE id = ... CREATE`.
