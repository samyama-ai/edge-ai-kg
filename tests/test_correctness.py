"""Validate catalog queries against ground truth computed in Python.

These tests exist because engine v1.7.0 has query-shape bugs that return
*plausible but wrong* rows (see docs/engine-notes.md). A query that runs and
returns rows is not evidence that it is right, so every structural claim the
demo makes is checked here against the generator's own data.

Runs against an in-process embedded engine, so no server is needed.
