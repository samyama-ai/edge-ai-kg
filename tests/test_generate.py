    `EA18` counts, per (deployment, operator), the kernels that implement the

    a fallback when that count is zero. With two accelerators on one
    deployment, `a` binds to either, kernels on **either** are counted
    together, and an operator covered on one accelerator but not the other
    stops looking like a fallback -- the query would under-report exactly the
    thing it exists to find.

    It cannot happen today: the generator writes one `_accel` per deployment
    (`etl/generate.py`), and the real layer one per MLPerf row. Measured at
    `--scale 1.0` across both layers, 1,451 deployments, maximum one each.
    That is a property of the generator rather than of the query, so if a
    future fleet gives a deployment two accelerators, this fails here and
    names `EA18` -- rather than `EA18` quietly returning a smaller number.
